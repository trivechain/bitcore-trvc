[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dashevo/bitcore-trvc.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/dashevo/bitcore-trvc)

Infrastructure to build Dash and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology.

**Note:** If you're looking for the bitcore-trvc Library please see: https://github.com/dashevo/bitcore-lib-trvc

## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have Node.js v4+ installed. There are several options for installation. One method is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between different versions, or download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npm install -g bitcore-trvc
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
npm install -g bitcore-trvc
bitcored
```

You can then view the Insight block explorer at the default location: `http://localhost:3001/insight`, and your configuration file will be found in your home directory at `~/.bitcore`.

Create a transaction:
```js
var bitcore = require('bitcore-trvc');
var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```
